# Catalyst-bed-for-hydrogen-peroxide
Calculate the decomposition rate, pressure drop and temperature in a catalystic bed for hydrogen peroxide.
Use a simplfied model to demonstrate the realationship between evapration, enthalpy conservation and flow pressure for hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity in a catalyst bed.   

Calation theory is base on a AIAA paper(Ref 1).
